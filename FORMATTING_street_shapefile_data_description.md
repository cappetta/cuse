Abstract:
    The Onondaga County street file is sponsored and maintained by
    the Syracuse-Onondaga County Planning Agency. The file is
    designed as an address management tool for a wide variety of
    applications. The most important of these applications is 911
    dispatching and public safety records. The Agency works closely
    with Onondaga County Emergency Communications to maximize
    accuracy and completeness. The street file is directly imported into
    the computer aided dispatch system at the 911 Center on a weekly
    basis. Problems are reported to and resolved by the Planning
    Agency. A significant effort has been made by the Agency to work
    with local governments and local US Postal Service officials to
    improve "real world" address conditions (house numbering, street
    spellings, etc). As a result of its constant use in a high volume
    environment, the address information in the street file is believed
    to be highly accurate and up to date. The street file is a reference
    file based on the Census Bureau's TIGER file. The original TIGER
    file was adapted by GDT in its Dynamap/2000 series for Onondaga
    County. Since the conversion, the line work of the file has been
    updated three times. In the first enhancement, the TIGER lines
    were conflated to the NYSDOT county base map. This process
    greatly enhanced positional accuracy of the street file. In the
    second enhancement, the lines were manually matched to the
    centerlines of the Onondaga County parcel base maps. The result is
    a street file that coincides directly with the best available local map
    (tax maps). Accuracy of the parcel base map is thought to be ± 40
    feet. The third enhancement was to manually match the
    centerlines to New York State digital orthoimagery captured in the
    Spring of 2003. For more information on the state orthoimagery,
    visit the New York State GIS Clearinghouse (http://gis.ny.gov/).
    The accuracy of the street file is now believed to be ±4 feet in
    urban areas and ±8 feet in rural areas.
Purpose:
The street file is designed as an address management tool for a
wide variety of applications.
