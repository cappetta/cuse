The Bureau of Information Technology (IT), runs all major applications 
on an IBM AS/400 mainframe and Windows servers which are networked to 
all City departments. Wide area networking has been implemented using 
fiber, T-1s, and broadband connections. The Financial (GL-Pur-AP-AR-CR) 
applications are out-sourced, but IS supports their T-1 connectivity. 

The following AS400 applications are supported in-house: 
RPS3, payroll, timekeeping, assessment, tax billing and collection, 
housing code enforcement, police/fire scheduling and attendance, 
water billing, service requests, and several other smaller systems. 

The Bureau serves as the support center for office automation and 
networking. City-wide there are several Windows 2003/2008 servers. 
Besides file and print serving, there are client-server applications 
for: Email, sports, fleet, CAD, GIS, parking tickets, RPS4, and 
accounting. 

In addition, there are web-based applications for: 
the Citywide web pages, assessment/tax lookup, tax payments, water 
payments, complaint line, vacant houses, IT project management, 
Business Licenses, and several Community Development databases.
